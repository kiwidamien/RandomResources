If short on time, there is Rocky Mountain track. From the previous link

| Rocky Mountain Track is another one of my favorite short Wanaka walks, and also a bit of a local secret. It’s on the way out to Mt. Aspiring National Park and is a nice little climb up to a big hill with views of the surrounding mountains and lake. This is a good hike to do if you don’t have a lot of time in Wanaka. It usually takes me an hour up and less than an hour down – it’s about 20 minutes from town.

Mt Iron is local and has views of downtown.

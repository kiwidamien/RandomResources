Seattle Suggestions
===================

Things to see and do in the Seattle Area

1. Make a (free) booking to visit the Amazon Spheres! May be closed during Covid, though.
2. See the Freemont Troll (`N 36th St, Seattle, WA 98103 <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fremont+Troll/@47.6516142,-122.3499584,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5490150128a784bd:0x9ddb04f1ce7199df!8m2!3d47.6516142!4d-122.3477697>`_) 
3. Same general area, see the statues in the Fremont area (including the US's largest statue of Lenin)
4. Seattle Japanese Garden is beautiful (especially around the Fall, if there in September)
5. The Chihuly glass museum by the space needle is really nice. There is also a glass museum out in Tacoma which is work a visit.
6. For "type II fun", try `mailbox peak hike <https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mailbox-peak>`_ just out of North Bend. The last part of the hike is a rock scramble.
7. Poo Poo Piont trail is a great hike where you can see paragliders base jumping from a cliff (`map <https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/poo-poo-point>`_)
8. (If open) the underground walking tour from Poineer Square is a fun way to learn about the history of Seattle.
9. `The Australian Pie Company <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Australian+Pie+Co/@47.4666489,-122.3403558,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x2d7cff5deb211bf8?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwik0rn6yvfwAhUOv54KHcPlDkYQ_BIwFXoECFMQBQ>`_ is a little drive out of Seattle, but gets you the best from Australia (and is cheaper than a flight)
10. `Kerry Park <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kerry+Park/@47.6294692,-122.3621111,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5490156a2e842d51:0x33f7681e2424b58e!8m2!3d47.6294692!4d-122.3599224>`_ is where you see the iconic pictures of the Seattle Skyline. Note the skyline in Frasier is fictional. Great at sunset.
11. A short walk from Kerry Park is Olympic Structures Park, which has a couple of fun sculptures, and allows you to run along the waterfront.
12. If you know people in the area, there are a couple of board game cafes that allow you to do rentals and eat. Cafe Mox is the one I like the most (they have a Ballard and Bellevue location)
13. If wanting to take a day trip, going out to Anacortes and doing an Orca watching tour is amazing! They have pretty good viewing throughout the summer months.

If you are up for a much longer drive, Rainier is a really nice national park, and is relatively cool in the summer too.

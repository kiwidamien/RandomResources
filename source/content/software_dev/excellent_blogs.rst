Overview
--------

Every article should be one of five things:

- A story
- An opinion
- A How-to
- How things work
- A Review

Improve your writing

- Read as a writer
- Bookmark articles by your favorite writers
- Read a relevant article, read to the end. Critique it: how could it be improved. What worked? What didn't?

Finding time to write
---------------------

* Just write infrequently
* Write when you have something to say
* Write reviews (short form) to keep

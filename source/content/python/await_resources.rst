Resources on asyncio
====================

* There is a whole series of docs on cloudfit-public-docs. I used them 
  extensively when making the blog post on getting sync code to run async.

  * https://bbc.github.io/cloudfit-public-docs/asyncio/asyncio-part-2.html
  * https://bbc.github.io/cloudfit-public-docs/asyncio/asyncio-part-5.html

  You should be able to replace these with other parts and get good articles as well

* This is a really good "start to end" view of asyncio:

Elm Wildlife Tours
------------------

Information here is a little bit scattered. Basically they will take you to see Albatross, Seals, and Yellow-eyed penguins along the 
Otago peninsula.
This is NOT a trip into the Catlins.
They do offer a Catlins tour, but that is for parties of 6 or more. From Tourism NZ website:

> Catlins Encounters and Stewart Island Connection â€“ Full-day nature tour along the Catlins coast with its amazing wildlife, forests, waterfalls, rivers, lakes and stunning coastal scenery. Combinations with onward options and connections to Stewart Island or the southern lakes make this tour a must do (group bookings only, minimum of six persons).

The reviews are generally pretty positive, although the Catlins waterfalls look amazing.

Catlins
-------

I have been to Nugget Point before, and to the Catlins. Last time I was not able to stay in the Catlins to see the yellow-eyed penguins
come back to the beach, and that is highly reviewed (e.g. `here <https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g7382821-d3600126-r159803132-Curio_Bay_Natural_Heritage_Centre-Curio_Bay_Southland_Region_South_Island.html>`__  which makes it sound easy, and `here <>`__  makes it seem more like a challenge>`__

New Zealand Recommendations
===========================

Having lived in New Zealand for quite a while, I frequently get asked about
suggestions for good trips or itineraries.
It felt like it was probably time to write something down.


.. note::
   A little about me (so you know what my biases are).
   I am generally more interested in hiking, wildlife,
   and landscape photography.

   I don't have a lot of interest in music festivals or
   nightlife/clubbing, so my suggestions won't be good for
   that.

   I am interested in musical theatre, but this is not an
   area that NZ excels


At some point I should get a series of ONLY NZ pictures, but 
`this collection <https://kiwidamien.github.io/photo_gallery/>`__
has a number of pictures from around NZ in there.


.. note::

   If you are planning a trip some time out, it is also worth checking out
   `the great walks <https://www.newzealand.com/us/feature/great-walks-of-new-zealand/>`__. I have not included these, as they often book up fast, but if you
   can get one, you should bump things off my list.


Around two weeks in NZ
----------------------

This assumes this is your first trip to NZ.

North Island
************

I would spend most of the time in the South Island (at least a week, preferrably
10 days).
There are still some things to see in the North Island, budgeting around 4 days.
Note that will not be enough time to see all these things (maybe Hamilton + Wellington in that time, or Auckland, Hamilton, Rotarua).


Auckland / Hamilton
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maybe spend one night in Auckland after you land.
It is a fairly "standard" city that you can find most
places in the world.

Would recommend Auckland if you are interested in sailing,
in particular the America's cup.

If not, you might want to go down to Hamilton and spend the
first day down there. 
The `Hamilton Gardens <https://hamiltongardens.co.nz/>`__ are a really 
impressive set of botanical gardens that you could easily spend a day at.

Waitomo
~~~~~~~

If heading down to Rotarua (next on the list) or Taupo, then spending some
time at the `glowworm caves <https://www.waitomo.com/glowworms-and-caves/waitomo-glowworm-caves>`__ is a great attraction.

This direction is also near "Hobbiton", where you can get a tour of the set.
I have never done this, but it seems pretty popular with Tourists.

Rotarua
~~~~~~~

The two big draws here are geothermal activity, and a lot of Maori culture being
showcased / performed. 
Like Lassen in California, or Yellowstone National Park, you should expect a lot
of sulfur smells.
If you have seen Yellowstone, you can probably skip this if the only attraction
is the geothermal areas.

There are a couple of hot spring beaches here that are worth visiting (and 
are free). The most popular one is `Hot Water Beach <https://www.thecoromandel.com/activities/must-do/hot-water-beach/>`__. You literally dig a hole in the sand, and
it is an instant natural hothub!


Coromandel Peninsula (skip unless really into beaches)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are really into water sports (surfing, paddle boating, spending time 
on the beach) *and* it is the middle of summer, this is one of the best beach
spots.

The towns on the Coromandel are very small, and there is not much else in the 
way of hikes, so I would skip this. Nelson (below) is a better choice, with
more interesting local hikes, and a bigger city.


Wellington
~~~~~~~~~~

Wellington is a great city; large enough to have an interesting selection of food
(much of NZ is very british with a "meat and potatoes" selection), while still
having a distinct personality of its own.

Oriental Bay is a really nice place to hang out on a sunny day, and Cuba street
has a lot of the art district.

Zealandia is a largish open area close to downtown Wellington, where you can
see a lot of the local birds.

The cable car ride (nothing in comparison to the SF system) is a nice way to get
to the top of the botanical garden and overlook the city.

The beehive (parliment building, roughly equivalent of the US capitol) is easy
to access too, and it is worth taking a tour.


South Island
************

I would not take the InterIslander across the straight, but instead fly from
Wellington to Christchurch. 


Nelson
~~~~~~

This is a really cute city at the top of the South Island.
It is one of the (relatively) few bright and sunny beach towns in NZ.
The wearable art festival is also here, and there is a great local artist
community.


Kaikoura
~~~~~~~~

This seaside town has some great lavendar fields, whale watching tours, and a
swim with dolphins experience that is pretty hard to beat.

Christchurch
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Christchurch is a garden city. I would recommend staying pretty close to downtown,
as the suburbs are not that interesting.
A specific location that was fun to stay was `Jailhouse Accomodation <https://www.jail.co.nz/>`__, an old prison that was converted into a hostel.

It is also within walking distance of the main downtown area, and central garden
area.

One of the big draws of Christchurch is the `Orana Wildlife Park <https://www.oranawildlifepark.co.nz/>`__ (aka the Christchurch Zoo).
It is pretty unique in having large open spaces for the animals, instead of the 
cramped cages you see in other places.
I was able to pet lion cubs there.

The small town of `Hamner Springs <https://hanmersprings.co.nz/>`__ is about a 90
minute drive out of Christchurch. I have never been in the winter, but I imagine
it would be beautful (hot springs in the middle of a mountain)


Banks Pennisula / Akaroa
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The town of `Akaroa <https://www.akaroa.com/>`__ is a former French colony 
very close to Christchurch.
It also has swimming with dolphins, and is a more accessible version of 
Kaikouria (Christchurch is one of the bigger places to fly into / out of).

There are also Little Blue Penguin colonies here that you can visit.

If you can spare the three days, the `Banks Track <https://www.bankstrack.co.nz/bookings/>`__ is a really amazing 3 day hike, with a couple of really unique huts along the trail.


Lake Tekapo
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is another dark sky location. There are some hot springs in the 
"town" (really just a single road with some restaurants) that do a
soak and stargazing event when the weather is clear.

This place is probably most famous for the color of the water in the lake
(an extremely cyan / aqua color) and the church.

* `daytime <https://imgur.com/gallery/gwbPJiH/new>`__, with the water color
* `nightime <https://www.churchofthegoodshepherd.org.nz/>`__, with the milky way


Wanaka
~~~~~~

Wanaka is great year around. 
It has what is claimed to be the most `Instagrammed tree <https://www.cntraveler.com/story/new-zealands-lake-wanaka-tree-is-being-destroyed-by-tourists>`__ is here.
This area is close to a lot of different hikes, with fantastic mountain and lake
views.


Te Anu and Milford Sound
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Te Anu is a nice, small NZ town, but it's main attraction is giving you access
to Milford Sound.
It is about a two hour drive from Te Anu to Milford Sound, where you can either do cruises or day hikes.

The day cruises are somewhat reasonably priced, and I think worth it.

This is where the `"wizard hat" <https://www.paulreiffer.com/2020/01/milford-sound-the-superstar-of-new-zealands-fiordland-national-park/>`__ is.

Aoraki (Mount Cook)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The YHA here is excellent!
* You can do a glacier hike from here. It is easier to get to than Fox Glacier, and there is a lower chance of the helicopter to the glacier being cancelled due to bad weather.
* Star gazing here is incredible.

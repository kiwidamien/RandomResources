Probabilitic Programming resources
==================================

`Bayesian Programming with JAX + NumPyro<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CecuWGpoztw>`_
is a nice 20 minute video on doing change point analysis in probabilistic programming.

`This forum post<https://forum.pyro.ai/t/parallelising-numpyro/2442/10>`_ has a nice
recipe for using joblib to parallelize tasks.

This `store dataset<https://florianwilhelm.info/2020/10/bayesian_hierarchical_modelling_at_scale/>`_
is one of my go-to examples on using numpyro on a larger scale.
Also referenced in my own `repo <https://github.com/kiwidamien/bayesian_modeling>`_
